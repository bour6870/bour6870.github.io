                                <p>The Study Hawks' mission is to provide Wilfrid Laurier University 
                                   students with up-to-date, relevant, and useful assistance during 
                                   exam season. We will strive to make this assistance accessible 
                                   to all students, and in doing so, we hope to drastically improve not only 
                                   the average grades of Wilfrid Laurier University students, but also their lives overall.</p>

                                <p>Effectively managing your time is essential in surviving exam season. At its core, time management
                                   is the process of planning and controlling the amount of time spent on different activities,
                                   and is often used to improve efficiency and increase productivity. This is essential
                                   for making it through exam season stress-free, and finishing with golden grades.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Planning</h3>
                                                       <p>Planning is an important first step in any successful attempt at managing your
                                                        time; not only will it keep you on track, it will also keep you motivated as you
                                                        continue to complete each task. Planning should be done well in advance and take
                                                        into consideration the day-to-day tasks which must be completed as well. An
                                                        effective study plan consists of the most important things you need to
                                                        accomplish (study) each day leading up to and during exam season. Each of these tasks
                                                        should then be alotted a percentage of time throughout your day determined by
                                                        its relative importance and how immediately it needs to be done.

                                   <h3 class="display-7">Procrastination</h3>
                                                       <p>Procrastination is the most prominent hinderence of proper exam preperation;
                                                        it quickly eats up time and before you know it, you've gotten almost nothing
                                                        done and now you're playing catch-up for the rest of exam season.
                                                        A quick and easy strategy to beating procrastination is simply getting started.
                                                        Getting started is often times the most difficult part of accomplishing anything,
                                                        and if you can do this, you'll usually find that the task gets progressively
                                                        easier once you have some momentum behind you.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Dealing With Distractions</h3>
                                                       <p>In 2017, distractions are everywhere, and none more prevelent than the device
                                                        everyone carries around in their pocket - the smartphone. Every smartphone comes
                                                        with the ability to download a host of different apps ranging from games
                                                        to social media that are great at stealing your precious time. One easy solution
                                                        to this problem, and you'll notice works when dealing with other distractions as
                                                        well, is removing the distraction altogether before it becomes a problem. We're
                                                        not saying to get rid of your phone, but thankfully there's another way.
                                                        Apps such as <a href="http://offtime.co/">Offtime</a> help you by restricting
                                                        phone usage from your most distracting apps. </p>

                                <p>There's a clear difference between studying and studying effectively; we prefer to work smart,
                                   not hard. This means making the most out of every minute spent studying, and wasting no time in getting
                                   started. Better study habits will not only improve your academic performance, but it'll leave you relaxing
                                   as exam season approaches (and not cramming like you did all through last year).</p>

                                <p>Let's be honest, the perfect study location can make or break a study session, and, during exam season, that's a risk
                                   we're not willing to take. A great study location is relatively quiet, well lit, and clear
                                   of any distractions that could pull your attention away from learning. In order to make the most of any
                                   study session, here are our picks for the best study locations on campus.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">The Library</h3>
                                                        <p>Located on Albert Street, between the Seminary and the Schlegal Centre, the Library
                                                        is a no-brainer when it comes to top-tier study locations. The floors get quieter as you
                                                        ascend, so you get your pick out of a variety of different atmospheres from the friendly
                                                        atmosphere in the 2nd floor Second Cup Coffee Shop, to the dreaded Silent Seven, and
                                                        everything in between. When it comes to exam season, it's better to get your seat sooner
                                                        rather than later as some students have been known to sleep in the library so they won't lose
                                                        their spots.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">The Solarium</h3>
                                                       <p>Located between the Wellness Centre and the Concourse, this comfortable
                                                        space, built of windows, is another perfect place to remove yourself from the
                                                        rest of the world and get in some quiet study time. Being entirely made of windows,
                                                        this space lets in the sunlight, keeps out the cold, and the views can be very aesthetic on a
                                                        snowy winter day.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Lazaridis Hall</h3>
                                                       <p>Located across University Avenue from campus, the new home of the Lazaridis School
                                                        of Business and Economics truly is everything your annoying business friend has made it
                                                        out to be. Amazing architecture, huge lecture halls, miles of study space (almost),
                                                        well-dressed students, and an air of eliteness. Studying here might not make you any
                                                        smarter, but the great atmosphere will certainly give you the confidence you need
                                                        heading into your exam season.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Career Centre</h3>
                                                       <p>A lesser-known study location, the Career Centre is located beside King Street Residence
                                                        and is perfect for anyone trying to get some alone time. The Career Centre is often

                                <p>Effectively managing your time is essential in surviving exam season. At its core, time management
                                   is the process of planning and controlling the amount of time spent on different activities,
                                   and is often used to improve efficiency and increase productivity. This is essential
                                   for making it through exam season stress-free, and finishing with golden grades.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Planning</h3>
                                                       <p>Planning is an important first step in any successful attempt at managing your
                                                        time; not only will it keep you on track, it will also keep you motivated as you
                                                        continue to complete each task in your plan. Planning should be done well in advance and take
                                                        into consideration the day-to-day tasks which must be completed as well. An
                                                        effective study plan consists of the most important things you need to
                                                        accomplish (study) each day leading up to and during exam season. Each of these tasks
                                                        should then be alotted a percentage of time throughout your day determined by
                                                        its relative importance and how immediately it needs to be done.
                                                        </p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Procrastination</h3>
                                                       <p>Procrastination is the most prominent hinderence of proper exam preperation;
                                                        it quickly eats up time and before you know it, you've gotten almost nothing
                                                        done and now you're playing catch-up for the rest of exam season.
                                                        A quick and easy strategy to beating procrastination is simply getting started.
                                                        Getting started is often times the most difficult part of accomplishing anything,
                                                        and if you can do this, you'll usually find that the task gets progressively
                                                        easier once you have some momentum behind you.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Dealing With Distractions</h3>
                                                       <p>In 2017, distractions are everywhere, and none more prevelent than the device
                                                        everyone carries around in their pocket - the smartphone. Every smartphone comes
                                                        with the ability to download a host of different apps ranging from games
                                                        to social media that are great at stealing your precious time. One easy solution
                                                        to this problem, and you'll notice this works when dealing with other distractions as
                                                        well, is removing the distraction altogether before it becomes a problem. We're
                                                        not saying to get rid of your phone, but thankfully there's another way.
                                                        Apps such as <a href="http://offtime.co/">Offtime</a> help you by restricting
                                                        phone usage from your most distracting apps, and effectively giving you back your day. </p>

                                <p>You can't fly high if you don't feel great.
                                   Remaining healthy is imperative in completing a happy and successful exam season. Maintaining
                                   proper health will not only make you feel great, it will also help you focus on your studies, more
                                   effectively retain information, and improve your cognitive function overall. Here are some of the most
                                   effective ways we stay healthy throughout the next exam season</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Exercise</h3>
                                                       <p>Exercise plays an important role in keeping you healthy. This means getting
                                                        up and getting active for at least an hour or two every day. If you're managing

                                                        great study break. Go for a run, hit the gym, play intramurals, or head down
                                                        to <a href="http://grandriverrocks.com/">Grand River Rocks</a> in Kitchener for an
                                                        afternoon of rock climbing. There are so many opportunities for getting active,
                                                        all it takes is a little research, and, above all, make sure you enjoy whatever you
                                                        choose, so you're always excited to get back at it!</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Proper Diet</h3>
                                                       <p>You know what they say, you are what you eat, and unfortunately, for us Canadians,
                                                        the food guide we've been forced to look at since we were in kindergarten just
                                                        doesn't quite cut it when it comes to a truly healthy diet. The two most important
                                                        aspects to a healthy diet are your net calorie intake, and the quality of foods you
                                                        eat on a day-to-day basis. All this means is you really need to pay attention to the amount
                                                        food you're eating, in order to make sure you're eating only enough to attain your own personal
                                                        health goals, and make sure your diet primarily (80% or more) consists of good whole,
                                                        nourishing foods. Walk the perimeter of the grocery store, turn on the Food Network,
                                                        cook for yourself, and you'll be well on your way to the diet of your dreams.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Coping With Stress</h3>
                                                       <p>Learning to manage stress is an important part of every day life, not to mention exam season
                                                        when stress levels spike to all-time highs. Fortunately for Laurier students everywhere,
                                                        many of the things we've already discussed can help you cope with life's stresses.
                                                        Learning to manage your time, and a proper exercise routine are both extremely effective
                                                        in attacking stress before it becomes a problem, and also reducing stress levels when
                                                        you feel like you just can't handle it anymore. When all else fails, setting everything
                                                        aside and just relaxing, or spending time with friends is a surefire way of destressing,
                                                        and also a worthwhile study break.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Sleep</h3>
                                                       <p>When life's coming at you full-speed, and you have 3 assignments, a presentation, and
                                                        5 finals to beign studying for, it can sometimes be easy to forget that one of
                                                        the most important aspects of staying healthy is getting proper sleep. As a
                                                        student you should be aiming to get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep every night.
                                                        Regularly getting more than 9 hours of sleep per night wastes your valuable time
                                                        and is bad for your health, whereas getting less than 7 on a regular basis can
                                                        be even worse. On top of that, the quality of your sleep matters as well. This
                                                        could mean slowing down on the binge drinking when exam season rolls around.
                                                        It's widely known that alcohol reduces the amount of REM sleep you get,
                                                        thus damaging your sleep quality, making you tired, stressing you out,
                                                        and detrimenting your gpa.</p>

                                   started. Better study habits will not only improve your academic performance, but it'll leave you relaxing
                                   as exam season approaches (and not cramming like you did all through last year).</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Proper Preperation</h3>
                                                       <p>Preperation is key if you're trying to get some golden grades this semester,
                                                        and the sooner you start, the better. You've probably heard it before, but
                                                        you really should be studying every day of the week. Imagine the kind of
                                                        progress you could make if you treated school like a full-time job; 8 hours per
                                                        day of classes, labs, and studying. You'll end up being much more prepared for
                                                        your exams, and still have evenings and weekends free to experience all of the
                                                        other great things Wilfrid Laurier University, and Waterloo have to offer. This
                                                        can be easily accomplished with a simple study schedule posted up somewhere in
                                                        room as a constant reminder that you're not digging yourself into student debt
                                                        to wake up hungover 4 days a week.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Study Techniques</h3>
                                                        <p>Working smart, means being efficient, and when it comes to studying, being 
                                                        efficient means studying properly, with the right techniques. One well-known
                                                        time management technique that has been adapted to studying with amazing results
                                                        is the Pomodoro Technique. This technique consists of studying hard for 20 minutes,
                                                        and then taking a 5 minute break, repeat this 3 times, and on your final
                                                        runthrough, take a 20 minute break instead. Repeat this whole process as many
                                                        times as you need. This technique works because as humans we can generally only
                                                        stay actively focused on a task for about 20 minutes at a time, any longer and
                                                        our focus begins to trail off, resulting in inefficient studying and information
                                                        retention. On your breaks feel free to pray to Francesco Cirillo, the developer
                                                        of the Pomodoro Technique, and Wilfrid Laurier himself to bless your gpa this
                                                        semester.</p>

              <h2 class="display-4">Locations</h2>
                                <p>Let's be honest, the perfect study location can make or break a study session, and, during exam season, that's a risk
                                   we're not willing to take. A great study location is relatively quiet, well lit, and clear
                                   of any distractions that could pull your attention away from learning. In order to make the most of any
                                   study session, here are our picks for the best study locations on campus.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">The Library</h3>
                                                        <p>Located on Albert Street, between the Seminary and the Schlegal Centre, the Library
                                                        is a no-brainer when it comes to top-tier study locations. The floors get quieter as you
                                                        ascend, so you get your pick out of a variety of different atmospheres from the friendly
                                                        atmosphere in the 2nd floor Second Cup Coffee Shop, to the dreaded Silent Seven, and
                                                        everything in between. When it comes to exam season, it's better to get your seat sooner
                                                        rather than later as some students have been known to sleep in the library so they won't lose
                                                        their spots.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">The Solarium</h3>
                                                       <p>Located between the Wellness Centre and the Concourse, this comfortable
                                                        space, built of windows, is another perfect place to remove yourself from the
                                                        rest of the world and get in some quiet study time. Being entirely made of windows,
                                                        this space lets in the sunlight, keeps out the cold, and the views can be very aesthetic on a
                                                        snowy winter day.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Lazaridis Hall</h3>
                                                       <p>Located across University Avenue from campus, the new home of the Lazaridis School
                                                        of Business and Economics truly is everything your annoying business friend has made it
                                                        out to be. Amazing architecture, huge lecture halls, miles of study space (almost),
                                                        well-dressed students, and an air of eliteness. Studying here might not make you any
                                                        smarter, but the great atmosphere will certainly give you the confidence you need
                                                        heading into your exam season.</p>
                                   <h3 class="display-7">Career Centre</h3>
                                                       <p>A lesser-known study location, the Career Centre is located beside King Street Residence
                                                        and is perfect for anyone trying to get some alone time. The Career Centre is often
                                                        relatively empty, providing ample space for those intellectual thoughts to flow, and for you
                                                        to get in those crucial study hours before and during exam season.</p>

<h1>Changes, Notes, and CynthiaSays</h1>
<p>This is an extremely simple HTML page outlining the changes we made between our conceptual website deisng, and our implementation.
This page also outlines the results and explanations from the tests we were supposed to run our website through. The description
given for how this page should be set up was a little bit vauge, so I hope the link I provided to this page from my website will not
be an issue.</p>
  
<h3>Website Layout</h3>
<p>The most evident change in our website is the decision to go from a hierarchical website layout, to a single-page format that
  reads more like a blog than anything else. We decided to do this for many reasons including the simple fact that we believed that
  it would be easier to construct a single paged website as apposed to a website consisting of multiple pages. we also believed
  that a single paged website would be a better layout for the information we have gathered at the moment and also be and easier medium
  to search through for assistance with one's studying needs (the sole purpose of our website). In making it read somewhat like a blog,
  we hope to connect with our target audience more, in that they will find comfort in the fact that they know the person writing the content
  is a student as well, and we are going through the same issues as they are. </p>
 
<h3>Website Name</h3>
<p>We decided to change the name of our website from "Exams at Laurier" to "Study Hawks" because we simply enjoy the name more, and
 we feel as though it still effectively describes the purpose of our website (it's great to be a Laurier Golden Hawk).</p>

<h3>Website Colour Scheme</h3>
<p>We have decided to use minimalistic, neutral colour scheme for our website instead of using any school related colours whatsoever,
   because we believe it to be easier on the eyes of the end user. We believe it makes our website more enjoyable to use overall.</p>

<h3>W3C Validator</h3>
<p>Our Website passed the W3C Validator with no issues.</p>

<h3>Cynthia Says</h3>
<p>There were some issues while running our website through Cynthia Says. These include the background images not having text alternatives
for those people who cannot see the images, colours on the website possibly not having enough contrast for those with colour deficiencies,
the images are missing alt attributes, and the use of figurative/specialize language that might confuse users with certain disabilities.</p>

<h3>CSS Validator</h3>
<p>There were some issues while running our website through the CSS Validator.</p>

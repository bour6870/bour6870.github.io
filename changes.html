<h1>Changes, Notes & CynthiaSays</h1>
  
  <h3>Website Layout</h3>
  <p>The most evident change in our website is the decision to go from a hierarchical website layout, to a single-page format that
  reads more like a blog than anything else. We decided to do this for many reasons including the simple fact that we believed that
  it would be easier to construct a single paged website as apposed to a website consisting of multiple pages. we also believed
  that a single paged website would be a better layout for the information we have gathered at the moment and also be and easier medium
  to search through for assistance with one's studying needs (the sole purpose of our website). In making it read somewhat like a blog,
  we hope to connect with our target audience more, in that they will find comfort in the fact that they know the person writing the content
  is a student as well, and we are going through the same issues as they are. </p>
 
 <h3>Website Name</h3>
 <p>We decided to change the name of our website from "Exams at Laurier" to "Study Hawks" because we simply enjoy the name more, and
 we feel as though it still effectively describes the purpose of our website (it's great to be a Laurier Golden Hawk).</p>
